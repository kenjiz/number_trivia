# Reso Coder's Number Trivia

An updated version of Reso Coder's Clean Architecture App project. Reso Coder's tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc3B_mMrZ-Q&t=23381s) is a great starting point of how Clean Architecture works on Flutter development. The only problem is, it was done three years ago with Flutter version of 1.9.1 and BloC v.1. This project is just an updated version of the source file for anyone reference using the latest Flutter and BloC version.

### How to run this project:

Launch your emulator and type this in your terminal.

    flutter pub get
    flutter run
